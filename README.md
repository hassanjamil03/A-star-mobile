# A-star-mobile
Mobile iphone app with a grid, where you draw on the grid some lines and place two points, then using the a-star algorithm is finds the shortest path between the two points
Running the app will also label this as "Test project". i am too lazy to change it to a proper name and find a cool image for the app homescreen preview.
